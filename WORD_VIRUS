                            ********************

Word 'virus' originates from latin, where it means 'toxic slime, poison'.
Correct way of handling latin words in english language is to use them
very much the same way by which the latins were originally using them
(that means with complicated assortment of endings for various
situations). In case of the latin word 'virus' it goes like this:

Form name: Used for:         Answers the question:
Nominative (naming)          (Who? What?)
Genitive   (possessing)      (How many? How much?
Dative     (indirect object) (To whom? To what?)
Acusative  (direct object)   (Whom? What?)
Vocative   (calling)
Ablative   (company,place)   (With whom? With what? Where?)

Form name:  Singular: Examples:
Nominative  virus     Virus is dangerous.
Genitive    viri      I have 1 viri.
Dative      viro      VE is a menace to viro.
Acusative   virum     VE has found 1 virum.
Vocative    vire      Hey thou, vire, show thyself!
Ablative    viro      They sold me software with viro inside.

Form name:  Plural:
Nominative  virum     Virum are dangerous.
Genitive    viri      I have many viri.
Dative      viro      VE is a menace to all viro.
Acusative   virum     VE has found 4 virum.
Vocative    virum     Hey you, virum, show yourself!
Ablative    viro      They sold me software with 4 viro inside.

Note: This is how the word 'virus' should be handled if it means an actual
biological virus. Doctors usually use latin words, so it is OK for them.

However, if it means a computer virus it addresses something that is
used by a variety of people without sofisticated language skills.
So it is appropriate to be treated as a synonym (another latin word,
meaning 'same word, different meaning', if I spelled it correctly).
This time however, it is a common english word and therefore it should
be treated as such, which simply means:

'words that end with an -s or -ss in singular, acquire an -es ending in
plural'

bus -> buses
grass -> grasses
virus -> viruses

It simplifies things greatly.
